# Try/Catch Rework — Feature Progress

This document tracks **all changes** related to removing `try/else`, introducing the new `try/catch` expression form, and aligning SSA + MIR + backend semantics with the updated error model.
It also defines the **next phases** so this feature lands without semantic or backend drift.

# 1. Completed in the current pass

### Surface syntax & AST

* Removed `try/else` entirely from grammar and AST.
* Added `TryCatchExpr` with catch-arm variants.
* Parser updated to support expression-form try/catch.
* Legacy `_lower_try_expr` code removed.

### Checker / interpreter / linter

* Statement and expression try/catch checking unified.
* Catch blocks must yield a value of the same type as the attempt.
* Binder is typed as `Error`.
* Interpreter updated to support expression-form try/catch.
* Linter updated accordingly.

### SSA lowering

* SSA lowering now **threads the actual `Error` value** on error edges.
* Both expression and statement forms carry the error into the catch blocks.
* Catch binders are wired to the SSA error parameter.
* Expression-form lowering:
  * Only supports **call attempts** (honest semantics) with simple `Name` / `Name.Attr` callees.
  * Supports multiple catch arms (event-specific + catch-all) with event dispatch via `ErrorEvent`; still call-only.
* Statement try/catch:
  * Requires the final statement of the try body to be a `Call(...)` expression (name or name.attr).
  * Supports **multiple catch clauses** (event-specific + catch-all); each lowered to its own SSA block with `Error` + locals threaded.
  * Error dispatch goes through a dedicated dispatch block that reads the error event/code (`ErrorEvent`) and picks the matching event catch in source order, then falls back to the first catch-all (or rethrows if none).
* SSA verifier understands `err_dest` on call terminators.
* SSA codegen trusts MIR’s `can_error` flags and asserts invariants; no backend rescanning.
* Throw lowering uses an explicit placeholder pair (no backend undef issues).
* `ErrorEvent` projection is available for dispatch and is lowered via the dummy runtime helper `drift_error_get_code`.

### Tests

New/updated e2e coverage:

* Invariants / misuse:
  * `call_plain_can_error`
  * `call_with_edges_non_can_error`
* Positive try/catch SSA semantics:
  * `try_call`
  * `try_call_error`
  * `try_catch`
  * `try_multi_catch`  (multi catch-all statement form)
  * `try_event_catch_stmt` (event dispatch in stmt form)
  * `try_expr_binder`  (expr try/catch with binder)
  * `try_event_catch_expr` (expr event dispatch)
* Projection primitive:
  * `mir_ssa_error_event_test` (ErrorEvent → drift_error_get_code end-to-end)
* Negative (intentional limitations):
  * `try_event_catch_expr_noncall` (expr attempt must be a call)

All SSA tests (`mir_ssa_tests`, `ssa_check_smoke`, `ssa_programs_test`) and e2e runner cases are passing.

### Spec & docs

* Grammar dropped `try/else`.
* DMIR grammar updated.
* Try/catch expression added to language spec.
* This work log tracks phase-by-phase changes.
* Docs now explicitly state:
  * Statement and expression try/catch support event-specific dispatch via the projected event/code.
  * Expression-form try/catch is still call-only; non-call attempts are rejected.

# 2. Current state of SSA lowering

## Expression form

Current `_lower_try_catch_expr`:

* Snapshots live user vars.
* Builds:
  * catch blocks (one per arm) with params `(Error, live locals...)`
  * dispatch block that reads `ErrorEvent` and selects matching event arms in order (fallback to catch-all or rethrow)
  * join block (result + locals)
* Emits a `Call` terminator with `normal` / `error` edges to the join/dispatch blocks.
* Wires catch binders to the `Error` parameter in each catch block.
* Only supports attempts that are calls with:
  * `Name` callee, e.g., `foo(x)`
  * `Name.Attr` callee, e.g., `obj.method(x)`
* Non-call attempts still yield `LoweringError` by design.

**Limitations**

* Attempts must remain call-shaped (Name / Name.Attr); broader attempts are deferred to Phase 2.
* At most one catch-all is allowed in the expression form.
* Runtime/SSA exposes an `ErrorEvent` projection (via `drift_error_get_code`) that returns the error’s event/code as an integer.

## Statement form

`lower_try_stmt`:

* Requires non-empty try body.
* Requires the final statement to be an `ExprStmt` wrapping a `Call(...)`:
  * Callee must be `Name` or `Name.Attr`.
* Lowers **all** catch clauses present in the source:
  * Each clause becomes a separate SSA block with params:
    * `Error` value
    * threaded live locals
  * Binder (if present) is bound to the `Error` param.
* Join block:
  * Threads live locals after the try/catch.
  * All fallthrough paths from catch blocks branch to this join with updated locals.
* Error dispatch:
  * Error edge now targets a **dispatch block**.
  * The dispatch block reads the event/code via `ErrorEvent`, compares against event-specific catch clauses in source order, and routes to the matching catch.
  * Falls back to the first catch-all if nothing matches; rethrows if there is no catch-all.
  * Event identifiers are currently encoded as deterministic integer codes assigned per exception definition and exposed via the dummy runtime’s `drift_error_get_code`.

---

# 3. Backend & Verifier

## SSAVerifierV2

* Recognizes `err_dest` on call terminators.
* Enforces terminator structure:
  * Only calls-with-edges may define both `dest` and `err_dest`.
* Ensures def-before-use and dominance for both value and error results.
* Validates `can_error` invariants based on MIR annotations.

## SSA Codegen

* No longer rescans MIR to infer can-error; it relies on MIR’s annotations and asserts invariants:
  * No `Throw` in non-`can_error` functions.
  * No call-with-edges to non-`can_error` callees.
  * No plain call to `can_error` callees.
* Splits `{T, Error*}` return pairs correctly.
* Branches based on `err != null` and threads locals through the CFG as set up by SSA lowering.

All aligned with the current SSA lowering shape.

# 4. Next Phases

These phases describe the remaining work to fully finish the try/catch redesign.

---

## Phase 1 — Full try/catch semantics in SSA

*(multi-catch + event matching + binder correctness)*

Status:

* **Phase 1a — Error event projection:** ✔ done. Added `ErrorEvent` MIR instruction, `_ssa_read_error_event` helper, SSA codegen lowering via `drift_error_get_code`, dummy runtime support, and SSA test coverage.
* **Phase 1b — Event dispatch:**
  * Statement form: ✔ done. Error edge now flows into a dispatch block that compares the projected event/code against event-specific catch clauses in order, with catch-all fallback (or rethrow if none). Event identifiers are deterministic integer codes assigned per exception definition.
  * Expression form: ✔ done. Call-only attempts dispatch through an expr-level dispatch block using `ErrorEvent`, support multiple catch arms (event-specific + catch-all), and rethrow if no arm matches.
  * Tests flipped to positive: `try_event_catch_stmt` and `try_event_catch_expr` now prove event dispatch and catch-all fallback; non-call attempts remain a compile error (`try_event_catch_expr_noncall`).

Remaining work:

* Broaden attempt surface for expressions beyond call shapes (Phase 2).
* Keep documenting that expressions remain call-only and allow a single catch-all.

---

## Phase 2 — Broaden “attempt” surface for expr try/catch

*(beyond direct calls)*

### Current decision

For now we adopt **Option A (safe & narrow)**:

* Expression try/catch only supports call-like attempts (`foo()`, `obj.method()` via `Name` / `Name.Attr`).
* Non-call attempts (e.g., `try x + y catch`) are a compile-time error; `try_event_catch_expr_noncall` enforces this.

Option B (full generalization via a dedicated try-body block) remains a future enhancement and is not planned for this phase.

### Goals (deferred)

* If/when broadening beyond calls:
  * Update `_lower_try_catch_expr` to build a dedicated try-body region.
  * Ensure that any throw in that region correctly routes to the catch arm.
  * Add negative tests for illegal attempt forms.
  * Update the language spec to reflect supported attempts.

---

## Phase 3 — SSA becomes the primary e2e backend

*(proof that error-edge semantics hold under real execution)*

### Goals

* Run all e2e programs through the SSA backend only.
* Validate end-to-end behavior for:
  * try/catch
  * throw
  * call-with-edges
  * error propagation

### Required steps

1. Run e2e programs through the SSA backend only.
2. Fix any backend/SSA discrepancies found.
3. Expand coverage until SSA is trusted as the main codegen path.

### Progress

* `tests/e2e_runner.py` always uses the SSA backend; legacy backend removed.  
* Justfile includes `test-e2e-ssa-subset` that runs via SSA backend:
  - `hello`
  - `throw_try`
  - `try_catch`
  - `try_call_error`
  - `try_event_catch_stmt`
  - `try_event_catch_expr`
  - `try_event_catch_no_fallback`
  - `array_string`
  - `for_array`
  - `console_hello`
  - `ref_struct_mutation`
* Added `ErrorEvent` projection wired to `drift_error_get_code` and a dedicated SSA test to ensure it codegens end-to-end.

---

## Reference Semantics (SSA)

### Goals

* Fully support `&` / `&mut` in SSA lowering and backend.
* Use `ReferenceType` consistently in SSA types.
* FieldGet/FieldSet operate correctly through references.
* Passing references across calls works; verified end-to-end.

### Status

* `ReferenceType` integrated into SSA lowering for borrows.
* SSA codegen maps references to pointers to the underlying type.
* FieldGet/FieldSet unwrap references and operate on struct layouts.
* E2E `ref_struct_mutation` proves mutation through `&mut` across a call (prints exit 42).

# 5. Final Cleanup Targets

These are reserved for after the 3 phases are complete.

* Remove duplicate try-lowering logic in `lower_to_mir.py`. ✅ done — legacy MIR lowering no longer carries try/else scaffolding and does not attempt to model full event-dispatch semantics (SSA is the source of truth).
* Update all spec examples to remove `try_else` remnants and align with the new SSA shape. ✅ done — grammar + error-handling/DMIR sections now describe multi-arm stmt/expr try/catch with event dispatch; no `try_else` remains.
* Consider a general “error dispatch” MIR op if we want multi-catch dispatch to be first-class.
* Audit lifetime and scope rules for catch binders (both stmt and expr forms).
* Ensure DMIR → SSA lowering path is unified, not forked. ◔ SSA path is authoritative; legacy MIR lowering is documented as minimal/legacy only.
* Reference semantics in SSA: ✔ `ReferenceType` throughout lowering/codegen, FieldGet/Set unwrap refs, refs passed as pointers, e2e `ref_struct_mutation` proves mutation across calls.
