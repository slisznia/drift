"""
Stage1 HIR normalization helpers.

At this stage the only normalization we perform is desugaring result-driven
try sugar (`HTryResult`) into explicit HIR using the TryResultRewriter.

This helper is meant to be called by the driver after AST→HIR and before
HIR→MIR so that sugar does not leak into later stages.

Type-awareness: the current rewrite is structural. Once the checker/type
environment is wired in, this helper should only be applied to HTryResult
nodes whose operand is known to be `FnResult<_, Error>` and where the
`is_err`/`unwrap`/`unwrap_err` methods exist. Keeping the helper here
makes the integration point explicit.
