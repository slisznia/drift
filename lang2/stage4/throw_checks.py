"""
Stage 4 helper: consume throw summaries and enforce basic can-throw invariants.

Pipeline placement:
  stage0 (AST) → stage1 (HIR) → stage2 (MIR) → stage3 (pre-analysis/throw summary)
  → stage4 (SSA + invariants) → LLVM/obj

This module combines stage3 ThrowSummary facts with type-level intent
(`declared_can_throw`) and performs simple checks. It keeps invariants out of
lowering/SSA so those passes stay structural.
