"""
Minimal type-environment protocol for future type-aware checks.

Stage4 throw checks will eventually use this to assert that return values in
can-throw functions are real `FnResult<_, Error>` values. For now it is a stub;
the real checker/type system will provide a concrete implementation. The API is
type-centric (not SSA-string-centric) to avoid repainting call sites later.
