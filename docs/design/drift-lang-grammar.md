# Drift Language Grammar 1.0 (syntax-only, normative for parsing)

This file defines the lexical rules, precedence, and productions for Drift. It is authoritative for **syntax**. The main language specification (`drift-lang-spec.md`) remains authoritative for **semantics** (ownership, types, runtime behavior). If syntax and semantics appear to conflict, parsing follows this document; meaning follows the main spec.

## 1. Lexical structure

- **Identifiers:** `Ident ::= [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`  
  Keywords (see reserved list in the main spec) are not identifiers.
- **Literals:** `IntLiteral`, `FloatLiteral`, `StringLiteral` (UTF-8), `BoolLiteral` (`true` / `false`).
- **Operators/punctuation:** `+ - * / % == != < <= > >= and or not ! ? : >> << |> <| . , : ; = -> => [ ] { } ( ) &`.
- **`mut` token:** `mut` is not reserved; it is treated as an identifier token and is meaningful after `&` in types/expressions.
- **Newlines / terminators:** The lexer may emit a `TERMINATOR` token on newline (`\n`) when **all** hold:
  1. Parenthesis/brace/bracket depth is zero.
  2. The previous token is “terminable” (identifiers, literals, `)`, `]`, `}`, `return`, `break`, etc.).
  3. The previous token is **not** an operator or separator that requires a follower (`+`, `*`, `>>`, `.`, `,`, `:`, `?`, etc.).
  Parsers may treat `TERMINATOR` like a semicolon; an explicit `;` is also allowed anywhere a `TERMINATOR` could appear.

## 2. Precedence and associativity (high → low)

1. Postfix: call `()`, index `[]`, member `.`, move `->`
2. Unary: `-`, `!`, `not`, `&`
3. Multiplicative: `*`, `/`, `%`
4. Additive: `+`, `-`
5. Comparisons: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
6. Boolean `and`
7. Boolean `or`
8. Pipeline `>>` (left-associative)
9. Ternary `?:` (right-associative)

### Notes

- Tuple types require at least two elements; `(T)` is just `T`.
- Pipelines use `>>` and are left-associative; `<<`, `|>`, `<|` are reserved tokens without current semantics.
- Zero-argument callables use `Void` as their argument type and are called with `f.call()`.
- This grammar is a reference for parsers; semantic rules (ownership, moves, errors) are defined in `drift-lang-spec.md`.
- In blocks, a bare expression must appear as a statement (`ExprStmt`) with a terminator (`;` or newline), e.g., `catch { 0; }` or `catch { return 0; }`. A future ergonomics pass may allow `{ 0 }` in expression contexts, but it is not supported today.
- Leading-dot expressions (`.foo`, `.foo(...)`) are only valid inside indexing brackets or argument lists; they desugar to member access on the receiver value (see §2.x “Receiver placeholder” in `drift-lang-spec.md` for semantics).
