# Drift development history

## 2025-11-20
- Captured the `lang.core.source_location` helper in the spec as a zero-cost intrinsic that lowers to the current file/line. Kept the data shape explicit (`SourceLocation` struct) so callsites can choose when to capture site metadata, thread it through `^` context bindings, or pass it into exceptions; avoided auto-injecting locations in the runtime to keep logging/telemetry opt-in. (Prototype interpreter still needs the intrinsic wired in.)
- Hardened comment and error conventions: grammar now allows both `//` line comments and `/* ... */` block comments (non-nesting) so we can annotate examples without fighting terminator insertion. Documented a standard `IndexError(container, index)` event for out-of-bounds accesses to make future bounds checks report consistent payloads instead of ad-hoc errors.
- Elevated error declarations to first-class language items with an `exception` keyword, aligning them with structs so constructors are typed and usable from the interpreter. Fixed the parser to ignore non-Tree nodes when assembling parameter lists, preventing stray tokens/comments from polluting function signatures. Added playground coverage for captures and structs so the sample suite exercises the new constructs.
- Tightened tooling guardrails: the draft linter now enforces tabs (default) vs spaces and checks snake_case/PascalCase across functions, parameters, bindings, structs, and exceptions to keep examples consistent with the style guide. The `just` recipes parse both `playground/` and `examples/` to catch grammar regressions immediately; we deliberately stayed with a lightweight custom linter instead of a full formatter while the syntax is still in flux.
- Worked through module signing requirements and concluded the pipeline should canonically sign an ANF-like DMIR and lower to SSA MIR for optimization/codegen; added an overview of that split to `docs/design-first-afm-then-ssa.md`.
