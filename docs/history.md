# Drift development history

## 2025-11-26
- Lowered `throw` of an exception constructor into a real `Error*`: pick `msg` kwarg/first positional or fall back to the exception name, call builtin `error_new`, and raise that pointer. Added an `error_new` builtin signature/stub for interpreter parity.
- MIR→LLVM now seeds successor environments correctly and treats helper calls (`error_new`/`error`) as returning bare `Error*` while other calls with error edges expect `{T, Error*}`. This fixed undefined-SSA issues in the emitter.
- Switched codegen to PIC/PIE: LLVM target machine uses `reloc="pic"`, C stubs/harness are built with `-fPIC`, and we link with `-pie` so we no longer need `-no-pie` or see text-relocation warnings.
- Unskipped the error-path codegen test and added a success-path sibling (`tests/mir_codegen/error_path_ok`) so both error and non-error return flows are exercised end-to-end.
- Defined a stable Error C ABI in the spec (UTF-8 strings, attrs/frames layout, ownership rules) and wired runtime stubs to match (`drift_error_new`, owned diagnostics, no static buffers). `throw` lowering now targets `drift_error_new`, and MIR→LLVM treats it as returning `Error*`. Added try/else and try/catch codegen cases and updated MIR goldens accordingly; all codegen tests pass.
- Added frame-array plumbing: lowering captures throw-site frames (file basename, func, line) and passes them to `drift_error_new`; MIR→LLVM supports string/int64 array init; runtime stubs store frames and free them; added `error_push_frame` hook for future deeper stacks. Added attr-array codegen tests (including large sets) to validate deterministic attrs and frame handling. Spec now notes the hidden ctx must never affect the public C ABI.
- Extended MIR lowering to handle `try/catch` statements: errors in the try body branch to a catch block (binder typed as `Error`), with a new MIR golden `tests/mir_lowering/try_catch.mir` covering the shape.
- Calls now always branch on `{T, Error*}` with explicit normal/error continuations: lowering wraps calls with normal/error blocks and a join, and the error path forwards to enclosing handlers so outer `try/catch` can intercept. Caller frames use call-site source lines, and throw-site frames use source basename/function/line. Added deep-frame codegen cases (`frames_chain`, `frames_one/two/three`) and domain default/override tests to exercise propagation.

## 2025-11-24
- Fixed the parser’s `if` builder to grab the nested `else_clause` block, so conditional statements with an else arm are preserved through parsing and lowering.
- Extended straight-line MIR lowering to handle `if/else` control flow (joins only when needed) and to reject functions that fall off without a return. Added a MIR golden for `if_else` in `tests/mir_lowering/` to cover the path.
- Aligned ternary lowering with a typed phi param at the join and updated the expected MIR formatting to match the printer/block ordering.
- Documented the FFI callback rules in the spec: only non-capturing functions cross the C ABI as callbacks; captured closures are not auto-boxed and require an explicit, manual state+trampoline if ever needed. Added a note for callbacks returned from C: treat function pointers (and optional ctx) as borrowed, enforce cdecl, block unwinding into C, and don’t assume ownership of ctx unless the API says so.
- Clarified destructor semantics in the spec: deterministic RAII at end-of-liveness (scope exit, early return, or consumption), move-only by default to avoid double drops, and copies only for `Copy` types with a defined copy+drop story.
- Clarified interface ownership: owned interface types should require `Destructible` so vtables always expose a drop slot; borrowed interface views omit destruction.
- Added a DMIR vtable section: interface values are fat pointers `{data, vtable}`; owned views require `Destructible` and dispatch `drop` via the vtable, borrowed views omit the drop slot, and vtable ordering is stable across inheritance (base entries first).
- Clarified multi-interface vtables: each interface gets its own per-type vtable; no merging across interfaces. Inheritance keeps base entries (including drop) at fixed offsets.
- Noted that a concrete type has a single destructor; every owned interface vtable for that type points its drop slot to the same concrete drop, so dropping via any interface dispatches identically.
- Stated explicitly in the spec: no class/struct inheritance; composition + traits + interfaces replace it to keep layout/ABI stable and avoid fragile-base/diamond issues.
- Added a closure preview to the spec: `|params| => expr` syntax with implicit return for expressions and explicit return for block form; explicit capture modes (default move consumes binding; `copy x` keeps a `Copy` value usable; borrow captures planned later alongside borrow/lifetime checking) to keep ownership clear; capturing closures lower to `{env_ptr, call_ptr}` with a single env destructor; non-capturing are thin function pointers; callable interfaces (`Fn`/`FnMut`/`FnOnce` style) can be auto-implemented based on capture mutability.
- Added an explicit `copy <expr>` expression to force duplication of `Copy` values (errors on non-`Copy`), usable in call args, closure captures, or bindings.
- Added a DMIR note for closures: capturing closures are fat `{env_ptr, call_ptr}` with a single env drop; non-capturing are thin pointers; callable interfaces can target the closure thunk/env.
- Added callable-usage examples: a single `Callable<Args, R>` interface with usage determined by how it’s passed—`ref` for pure reuse, `ref mut` for stateful reuse, by value to consume (single-use for move-only callables, duplicating `Copy` ones).
- Added a TODO track for closure implementation: lower closure literals to `{env_ptr, call_ptr}`, generate thunks, represent thin/fat closures in MIR/LLVM with env drops, wire callable invocation/desugaring, and add borrow captures once borrow checking is available.
- Clarified DMP threat model and verification: signatures are checked only at import/compile time (not at runtime), and DMP guards against supply-chain tampering, not against attackers who already control the compiler/linker/runtime.
- Extended the MIR verifier’s dataflow: propagate defs/types across blocks and use propagated types for edge arg checking; CFG validation now uses out-state from the dataflow pass.
- Wired the MIR verifier into MIR golden tests; fixed edge checking to use propagated out-state so branch/phi args and returns validate across blocks.
- Integrated MIR verification into `driftc` so MIR is checked before LLVM codegen in the `mir-codegen` path.
- Added negative verifier tests (use-before-def, edge arity mismatch) to the test runner to ensure the verifier rejects bad MIR.
- Added a dominance-violation negative test (missing join arg) to the verifier suite to ensure defs must reach all predecessors.
- Added an edge type-mismatch negative test to cover edge param type validation.
- Added an edge undefined-arg negative test to ensure edges only reference values defined in the source block.
- Added ownership negative tests (use-after-move, double-drop) to exercise the verifier’s ownership rules.
- Added a return-type mismatch negative test to ensure returns match the function’s declared type.
- Added an error-edge type negative test to ensure `raise` carries `Error` and error edges have correct types.
- Added a missing-terminator negative test to enforce that every block ends in a terminator.
- Added an unknown-block negative test to ensure edges cannot target nonexistent blocks.
- Added an end-to-end MIR→LLVM→clang codegen test harness (`tests/mir_codegen/`), with a sample add case; harness is skipped when llvmlite/clang-15 are unavailable.
- Restored call normal/error edges and treated call-with-edges as terminators in the verifier/CFG/dataflow; MIR→LLVM now branches to call successors (placeholder success check; error payload TBD).
- Documented the Error ABI: errors are heap-allocated `Error*` owned by the caller; calls return `{T, Error*}` (or `Error*` for Error returns), branch on `err == null`, and propagate the pointer along error edges; handlers/freeing happen at catch/top-level.
- Defined the Error object layout for the ABI: `Error*` heap object with event id/name, preformatted args, ctx frames, backtrace handle; opaque to user code; caller frees via `error_free` unless propagating.
- Lowered `raise` in MIR→LLVM: returns an `{T, Error*}` pair with the error pointer (or `Error*` directly for Error-returning functions) along the error path; still a placeholder until full error ABI is wired through calls.
- Added a codegen skip for the planned error-path test until runtime error helpers and real error ABI wiring are in place.

## 2025-11-20
- Captured the `lang.core.source_location` helper in the spec as a zero-cost intrinsic that lowers to the current file/line. Kept the data shape explicit (`SourceLocation` struct) so callsites can choose when to capture site metadata, thread it through `^` context bindings, or pass it into exceptions; avoided auto-injecting locations in the runtime to keep logging/telemetry opt-in. (Prototype interpreter still needs the intrinsic wired in.)
- Hardened comment and error conventions: grammar now allows both `//` line comments and `/* ... */` block comments (non-nesting) so we can annotate examples without fighting terminator insertion. Documented a standard `IndexError(container, index)` event for out-of-bounds accesses to make future bounds checks report consistent payloads instead of ad-hoc errors.
- Elevated error declarations to first-class language items with an `exception` keyword, aligning them with structs so constructors are typed and usable from the interpreter. Fixed the parser to ignore non-Tree nodes when assembling parameter lists, preventing stray tokens/comments from polluting function signatures. Added playground coverage for captures and structs so the sample suite exercises the new constructs.
- Tightened tooling guardrails: the draft linter now enforces tabs (default) vs spaces and checks snake_case/PascalCase across functions, parameters, bindings, structs, and exceptions to keep examples consistent with the style guide. The `just` recipes parse both `playground/` and `examples/` to catch grammar regressions immediately; we deliberately stayed with a lightweight custom linter instead of a full formatter while the syntax is still in flux.
- Worked through module signing requirements and concluded the pipeline should canonically sign an ANF-like DMIR and lower to SSA MIR for optimization/codegen; added an overview of that split to `docs/design-first-afm-then-ssa.md`.
- Adopted a policy of fully monomorphizing generics (no shared reified bodies) so DMIR/SSA always see concrete types; watch for code-size blowups in heavily polymorphic code, but favor optimizer simplicity and performance first.
## 2025-11-23
- Added a DMIR draft spec and cleaned up primitive notes (ConsoleOut treated as runtime-provided only). Expanded control surface with ternary `?:`, plus try/catch and inline try/else support wired through grammar, parser, checker, interpreter, linter, and new runtime tests (including a ternary test case in `tests/`).
- Runtime now enforces array bounds with `IndexError(container, index)` and prints errors in the spec’s structured format with a simple call-stack capture; added runtime tests for out-of-bounds and error reporting.
- Documented DMIR canonicalization rules (naming, ordering, kwarg normalization) and added surface→DMIR examples for ternary, try/else, and constructors to stabilize the signing format. Approved SSA MIR control-flow model and value/ownership rules (monomorphized, move-only by default, explicit error edges, drops in MIR).
- Documented the SSA MIR instruction palette (const/move/copy/call with normal+error edges, struct/array ops, unary/binary, drop) in `docs/dmir-spec.md`; TODO updated accordingly.
- Added end-to-end surface→DMIR→SSA MIR examples (ternary, inline try/else with fallback) to ground the IR design.
- Added SSA MIR terminology/conventions (block labels, params-as-φ, SSA defs, explicit call successors, ownership rules).
- Added a CFG block notation alongside the ternary SSA example to visualize control flow and φ-like params.
- Added CFG notation to the try/else SSA example for readability.
- Added verifier expectations to the SSA MIR terminology section (SSA dominance, types, ownership, drops, terminators).
- Added a MIR verifier checklist to the DMIR spec so readers know the invariants to enforce before optimizations/codegen.
- Added initial MIR data structures (`lang/mir.py`) to model SSA blocks, instructions, edges, and programs; tests still pass.
- Added a skeleton MIR verifier (`lang/mir_verifier.py`) covering SSA def/use, ownership moves/drops, edge/param arity, and basic terminator checks.
- Clarified dominance in the SSA terminology (defs must appear on every path to their uses).
- Documented the verifier implementation sketch (input, steps, output) in the DMIR spec.
- Enriched MIR nodes with source locations and wired the verifier to report locations on errors.
- Extended the MIR verifier with partial type tracking (propagating known types, checking calls against known function signatures, return/raise types) while still passing existing tests.
- Added CFG reachability and edge/arg/param/type checks in the MIR verifier (ensuring edge args are defined in source blocks and match dest param types where known).
- Added incoming edge arg/param validation to the MIR verifier to align predecessor args with block params across the CFG.
- Relaxed the MIR call shape to allow optional normal/error edges; updated printer/verifier accordingly to ease initial lowering.
- Added a MIR printer (`lang/mir_printer.py`) and a minimal straight-line lowering path (`lang/lower_to_mir.py`) with a MIR golden test wired into `tests/run_tests.py`.
- Added a minimal MIR→LLVM emitter (`lang/mir_to_llvm.py`) for straight-line functions and a `mir-codegen` just target that lowers `tests/mir_lowering/add.drift` to an object and links/runs it via clang-15/llvmlite.
- Introduced `lang/driftc.py` as a minimal Drift→MIR→LLVM driver (straight-line subset) and moved the MIR codegen harness out of `tools/test-llvm/` into `tests/mir_lowering/`.
- Fixed import shadowing (lang/types vs stdlib types) by adjusting `lang/driftc.py` sys.path handling and invoking it as a module; `just mir-codegen` now runs end-to-end producing and running a native binary.
- Added initial MIR data structures (`lang/mir.py`) to model SSA blocks, instructions, edges, and programs; tests still pass.
